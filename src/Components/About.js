          Hi there, my name is <strong>Mitchell Bristow</strong>, and I'm a web
          developer. I love using <em>React JavaScript</em> to build awesome
          interfaces that people can use online.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing the guitar and video games. I use
          the guitar to express my feelings through music, and video games are a
          fun way to take a break and have some fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what I'm really passionate about is using data and technology to
          understand forex trading. I love studying financial markets and
          finding patterns in the numbers. I want to create tools that help
          other traders make smarter decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a nutshell, I'm Mitchell Bristow, a web developer who loves music,
          gaming, and exploring data for forex trading. My goal is to make
          things that look great online, play music that speaks to the soul, and
          using data to help traders succeed.
